## Usage
 - Users can "save" the place that they find interesting, this includes saving an uploaded picture or (if allowed) taking pictures from user's camera, place name, city and the location.
 - The website will ask users for their permissions to access their locations and in the end, save it into the respective post (with name of the place and the city - these 2 informations should be added manually by users).
 - When users click on "Go To Map", they will be linked to a Google Map site.

## Used technologies 

- Frontend: HTML & CSS with [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/): A modern responsive CSS framework based on Material Design by Google.
- Backend: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): A Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) app development platform that provides hosted backend services. **Savetheplace** uses its NoSQL cloud storage, and hosting static files services. 

## About Progessive Web App

Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed so they are **capable, reliable, and installable**
- **Capable**: **Savetheplace** can access user file system, geolocation and camera. It can also can synchronize data in the background. 
- **Reliable** means that it work fast and dependable regardless of the network (Or in 
another word: Scrolling and animation should feel smooth, the website works on every browsers and even is offline usable)
- **Installable**: **Savetheplace** can run in a standalone window instead of a browser tab. It is launchable from on the user's home screen, dock, taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the device they're installed on.
