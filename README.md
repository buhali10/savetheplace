## About Savetheplace

**Savetheplace** is a Progessive Web App (PWA). 
Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed so they are **capable, reliable, and installable**
- **Capable** means that it has features like file system access, geolocation access, and push notifications. It can also can synchronize data in the background.
- **Reliable** means that it work fast and dependable regardless of the network (Or in 
another word: Scrolling and animation should feel smooth, work on every browsers and even be offline usable)
- **Installable** means that it can run in a standalone window instead of a browser tab. It is  launchable from on the user's home screen, dock, taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the device they're installed on.

 - When user click on "Go To Map", they will be linked to a Google Map site.
